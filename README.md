jasper-client
=============

***NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, PLEASE MAKE A PULL REQUEST IF YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP.***

I just found a project that has much more support and a much bigger community that continues the jasper project. See link here: https://github.com/NaomiProject/Naomi

Client code for the Jasper voice computing platform. Jasper is an open source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications.

Learn more at [jasperproject.github.io](http://jasperproject.github.io/), where we have assembly and installation instructions, as well as extensive documentation. For the relevant disk image, please visit [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperproject/).

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to Jasper, please read through our **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)**, which outlines the philosophies to preserve, tests to run, and more. We highly recommend reading through this guide before writing any code.

The Contributing Guide also outlines some prospective features and areas that could use love. However, for a more thorough overview of Jasper's direction and goals, check out the **[Product Roadmap](https://github.com/jasperproject/jasper-client/wiki/Roadmap)**.
