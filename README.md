=============

Client code for the Jasper voice computing platform. Jasper is an open source platform for developing always-on, voice-controlled applications.

Learn more at [jasperproject.github.io](http://jasperproject.github.io/), where we have assembly and installation instructions, as well as extensive documentation. For the image and or binary you needed, please visit [Sourceforge] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasperproject/).

## Contact

Jasper is developed by [Shubhro Saha](http://www.princeton.edu/~saha/) and [Charles Marsh](http://www.princeton.edu/~crmarsh/). Both can be reached by email at [saha@princeton.edu](mailto:saha@princeton.edu) and [crmarsh@princeton.edu](mailto:crmarsh@princeton.edu) respectively.

## Major Updates

- 2014-05-27: The network setup wizard has been removed because of unreliability. The client code and documentation has been updated, requiring new users to manually configure their `/etc/network/interfaces` file.
